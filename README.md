![!app-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamAbayomi/dao-open-challenge/main/public/open-dao-main.jpg) 

The web version of the Druids challenge done by [Queennette Onyekachi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/queennettekachi/) and [Temidayo Folajin](https://temidayofolajin.webflow.io/).  

## Technologies
It was fun to use Chakra-UI, Reactjs, Nextjs, Typescript, CSS transitions and Animation. Also, I used Chakraâ€™s UI Custom Checkbox and RadioButton, I know it can be a little tricky to implement if you are a beginner.
